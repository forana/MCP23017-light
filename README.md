This is a small subset of the MCP23017's functionality for Arduino. It's all that I needed - I'll add more to it when I need more, but PRs welcome.

Consider this a spiritual fork of [Adafruit's wonderful library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-MCP23017-Arduino-Library/) - the major difference is that I added Teensy support and cut a lot of corners. You _probably_ want to use theirs.
